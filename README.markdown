# OverZealous Creations Remark

**Remark** is a library for taking (X)HTML input and outputting clean [Markdown][], [Markdown Extra][], or [MultiMarkdown][] compatible text.  The purpose of this conversion is mainly to allow for the use of client-side HTML GUI editors while retaining safe, mobile-device editable markdown text behind the scenes.  It is recommended that the markdown text is stored, to reduce XSS attacks by code injection.

## About this fork

This fork was created in order to convert Maven build system to Gradle and deploy library to Maven Central Repository.

**Please note that this fork is no longer maintained.**

## Example Usage Scenario

 * The user logs in from their desktop.
     * Adding some text, the user inputs into a full-featured GUI, such as [Dojo's rich text editor][dojo_rte], or [any of these editors][other_rtes].
     * The webserver takes the generated HTML, which may contain a lot of bad HTML, depending on the browser, and passes it to **Remark**.
         * **Remark** passes the HTML to [jsoup][], to clean up the input text, which strips unsupported HTML tags (the text will remain).
         * **Remark** walks the generated DOM tree, and outputs clean, structured markdown text.
         * The markdown text is returned.
     * The webserver stores this markdown text for future display.
 * The user chooses to re-edit the HTML text from their desktop.
     * The webserver converts the Markdown back to HTML, and sends it to the client.
     * Repeat the steps above to save it.
 * The user later logs in from their mobile device.
     * Mobile devices often not support rich text editing through the web browser.
     * So, instead, render a plain text field with the raw markdown text.
     * Because markdown is relatively easy to read and edit, the user can make simple changes without struggling with hundreds of messy HTML tags.

## Advanced Features

**Remark** can be configured to output extra functionality beyond straight markdown.

 * [Markdown Extra tables][] or [Multimarkdown tables][] (which add column spanning support), including a best-guess attempt at alignment (based on style or align attributes)
 * Reversal of various smart HTML entities or unicode characters:
     * `&ldquo;` (“) and `&rdquo;` (”) become `"`
     * `&lsquo;` (‘), `&rsquo;` (’), and `&apos;` become `'`
     * `&laquo;` («) becomes `<<`
     * `&raquo;` (») becomes `>>`
     * `&hellip;` (…) becomes `...`
     * `&endash;` (–) becomes `--`
     * `&emdash;` (—) becomes `---`
 * Simplified hardwraps — A `<br/>` is converted to just a single linebreak, instead of `(space)(space)(newline)`, common in most third-party markdown renderers
 * Autolinks — a link that has the same content as it's label (and starts with http or https) is simply rendered as is, like `http://www.overzealous.com`
 * [Markdown Extra definition lists][]
 * [Markdown Extra abbreviations][]
 * [Markdown Extra header IDs][]
 * Fenced code blocks, using either [Markdown Extra's format][Markdown Extra fenced code block] using `~~~`, or [Github's format][Github fenced code block] using ` ``` `
 * Customization of allowed HTML tags - not really recommended.

The basic theory is that you match the extensions to your Markdown conversion library.

## Dependencies

**Remark** depends on [jsoup][] and [Apache Commons Lang 3][].  If you want to use it from the command line, it also depends on [Apache Commons CLI][].  Alternatively, you can download the standalone version of the Jar, which contains all the dependencies.

jsoup uses the [MIT License][jsoup license], which is roughly comparable to the [Apache 2.0 License][] used by Remark and the Apache dependencies.

During testing, **Remark** also depends on some additional libraries, which are automatically downloaded by the gradle build script.

## License

**Remark** is released under the [Apache 2.0 license][].
